  * Ubuntu release of 0.6

 -- Dave Jones <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Thu, 21 Jan 2016 23:24:27 +0000

picraft (0.6-1) stable; urgency=low

  * A new "sphere" generator function was added (#13)
  * The "blocks" attribute was updated to permit arbitrary sequences of
    vectors to be queried and assigned
  * Event decorators can now be used in classes with the new "@has_handlers"
    decorator (#14)
  * Installation instructions have been simplified, along with several recipes
    and code examples throughout the docs (#15, #16)
  * When used with a Raspberry Juice server, chat events can now be monitored
    and reacted to using event decorators (#19); many thanks to GitHub user
    wh11e7rue for not just suggesting the idea but providing a fantastically
    complete pull-request implementing it!
  * The default for "ignore_errors" was changed so that picraft's network
    behaviour now matches mcpi's by default (#18)
  * A silly bug in "circle" prevented the center parameter from working
    correctly

picraft (0.5-1ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Ubuntu release of 0.5

 -- Dave Jones <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Thu, 10 Sep 2015 23:49:20 +0100

picraft (0.5-1) stable; urgency=low

  * The major news is the new obj loader and renderer in the "Model" class.
    This includes lots of good stuff like bounds calculation, scaling,
    material mapping by map or by callable, sub-component querying by group,
    etc. It's also tolerably quick (#10)
  * As part of this work a new function was added to calculate the coordinates
    necessary to fill a polygon. This is the new "filled" function (#12)
  * Lots more doc revisions, including new and fixed recipes, lots more
    screenshots, and extensions to the chapter documenting vectors.

picraft (0.4-1ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Ubuntu release of 0.4

 -- Dave Jones <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Sun, 19 Jul 2015 00:44:46 +0100

picraft (0.4-1) stable; urgency=low

  * The events system has been expanded considerably to include an
    event-driven programming paradigm (decorate functions to tell picraft when
    to call them, e.g. in response to player movement or block hits). This
    includes the ability to run event handlers in parallel with automatic
    threading
  * Add support for circle drawing through an arbitrary plane. I'm still not
    happy with the implementation, and may revise it in future editions, but I
    am happy with the API so it's worth releasing for now (#7)
  * Add Raspbian packaging; we've probably got to the point where I need to
    start making guarantees about backward compatibililty in which case it's
    probably time to make this more generally accessible by including deb
    packaging (#8)
  * Lots of doc revisions including a new vectors chapter, more recipes, and
    so on!

picraft (0.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add support for querying a range of blocks with one transaction on the
    Raspberry Juice server (#1)
  * Add support for rotation of vectors about an arbitrary line (#6)
  * Add bitwise operations and rounding of vectors
  * Lots of documentation updates (fixes to links, new recipes, events
    documented properly, etc.)

 -- Dave Jones <dave@waveform.org.uk>  Sun, 21 Jun 2015 22:05:03 +0100

picraft (0.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Fix a stupid error which caused "block.data" and "block.color" (which make
    up the block database) to be excluded from the PyPI build (#3)
  * Fix being able to set empty block ranges (#2)
  * Fix being able to set block ranges with non-unit steps (#4)
  * Preliminary implementation of getBlocks support (#1)
